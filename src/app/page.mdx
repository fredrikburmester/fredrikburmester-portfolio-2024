### Understand large datasets through knowledge graphs.

**Orbit is a powerful tool designed to represent complex datasets in a more intuitive way, offering a clear alternative to traditional spreadsheet software like Excel.**

As datasets grow in size and complexity, Excel's limitations become evident, often leading to cumbersome and error-prone data management. Orbit overcomes these challenges by transforming data into a knowledge graph, where relationships and dependencies are visually mapped out. This approach not only simplifies the understanding of complex data but also enables dynamic querying and analysis that would be difficult to achieve with conventional spreadsheets.
